Phylogenetics constructed workflow

Standard phylogeentic workfloes using different packages avaliable on R, Python, Linux.
Details about the packages (e.g. developers) and explanation for code segment will be provided in every workflow.
Every script is inspired from the developes' guidelines and enriched with some personal inspirations
Thus I want to thank beforehand the people behind these packages I would like to state that I do not own any rights and all credits go to the creators.

Happy coding!
